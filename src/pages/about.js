        <p className={' pt-4'}>I was born and raised in a town called
          Rapallo, that overlooks the Ligurian Sea to which I own a lot of my
          personal growth.
          After graduating as an graphic design, I decided to deepen my course
          of study following my great passion for graphics at NABA in Milan
          where I got my first <b>degree in Graphic Design and Art Direction</b>.
          I was
          then attracted by the communication and graphics that focused on
          fashion design, so I continued my course of study enrolling in a
          Masterâ€™s in <b>Design for the Fashion System at Politecnico di
            Milano</b>,
          which I am currently attending.
          I have always found interesting the link that stands between
          communication and fashion; I am firmly convinced that one could not
          exist without the other. This is why I wish that one day, the
          combination of fashion and communication, could became what my job
          will be based on.
